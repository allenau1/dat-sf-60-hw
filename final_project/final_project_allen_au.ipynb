    "\n",
    "Visibility into Real Estate market has historically been opaque and segregated through local Multiple Listing Service (MLS) systems.  The understanding of a local market required a personal relationship with a Real Estate Broker with access to a local MLS sytesm.  Real Estate investment continues to be challenged with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost\n",
    "1. Requires a signifant capitol outlay \n",
    "2. Less liquid investment compared to stocks\n",
    "3. Transaction cost is significant (closing cost, escrow, real estate agents, attourney fees, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predictablity**\n",
    "3. Real Estate valuation can be emotional and subjective\n",
    "4. Minimal insight into local market trends\n",
